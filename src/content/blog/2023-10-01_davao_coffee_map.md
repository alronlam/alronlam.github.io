Happy International Coffee Day! â˜•

I was curious about the coffee scene in Davao City, as it seemed like every month a couple of new stores were popping up. So I whipped up this map plotting all coffee shops (pulled from Google Maps) along with the areas that are within a 5 minute walk to them. The circle size represents the shop's popularity according to the number of Google Maps ratings.

For coffee lovers like you and me, this map makes it easier to find hidden gems in the city. The next time I'm itching to try a new coffee shop, I'll definitely consult this map! If you'd like to try it too, here's a digital, interactive version where you can see the names and addresses: https://bit.ly/davao-coffeemap

From a business perspective, this allows us to see underserved areas at a glance (the whitespaces on the map). When combined with other datasets such as population density and socio-demographics, maps can be powerful tools in selecting profitable store locations.
