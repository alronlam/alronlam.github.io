        I was most recently a <b>Machine Learning Consultant</b> and <b
          >Engineering Manager</b
        >
        of the Geospatial team at <a
          class="link"
          href="https://thinkingmachin.es"
          target="_blank"><b>Thinking Machines Data Science</b></a
        >, where I shape our technical strategy for project delivery efficiency
        and co-manage our 10-person team of analysts, machine learning
        consultants, and software engineers.
        <br /><br />
        My 7-year experience in AI has made me an end-to-end generalist as I collaboratively
        designed and built ML systems: from data engineering, ML modelling, backend
        API development, to DevOps. I started out specializing in Natural Language
        Processing (NLP) for 5 years before shifting my focus to Geospatial Analytics
        in the past 2 years. At the end of the day, I love working with a team to
        build systems that positively impact our end-users.

        <br /><br />
        Almost all of my projects in corporate are (understandably) confidential,
        so I created this website to share side-projects that are fit for public
        consumption. I hope you enjoy looking through them as much as I enjoyed creating
        them!

    title="Charge [2013]"
    img="/project_imgs/charge.png"
    desc={'Published Windows Phone game with 12k+ downloads. Made for a Microsoft hackathon in 2013. This is a video-game re-imagining of the popular Filipino kid game called Charge (played in real life with hand actions). The core concept is to "Charge" up, use your charges to "Wave" and attack your opponent, which you can "Block". Getting hit by a "Wave" from your opponent while you\'re "Charging" means game over for you. This video-game takes that core concept and turns it into a semi-rhythm game. Much like the rock-paper-scissors chant, you have to tap and choose your action in time with the beat to defeat the AI! Unfortunately, the Windows Phone store has shut down and so the game is not available anymore.'}

Every character is dynamically generated for each new run of the game. Warning: The game is unpolished as this was made in ~24 hours and was our first hackathon ever during our 3rd year as BS Computer Science students. No game engine was used; this was pure HTML/CSS/JS!"
