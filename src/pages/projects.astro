This is a semantic search tool to surface relevant verses and chapters in the Bible for a topic of interest using embeddings and Question-Answering models. Yes, this was made before ChatGPT exploded; I worked on it very sparingly on-and-off since 2020. I'm hoping to improve this with ChatGPT's API soon. But if anything, this should run faster and displays whole chapters for better context."

    title="Charge [2013]"
    img="/project_imgs/charge.png"
    desc={'Published Windows Phone game with 12k+ downloads. Made for a Microsoft hackathon in 2013. This is a video-game re-imagining of the popular Filipino kid game called Charge (played in real life with hand actions). The core concept is to "Charge" up, use your charges to "Wave" and attack your opponent, which you can "Block". Getting hit by a "Wave" from your opponent while you\'re "Charging" means game over for you. This video-game takes that core concept and turns it into a semi-rhythm game. Much like the rock-paper-scissors chant, you have to tap and choose your action in time with the beat to defeat the AI! Unfortunately, the Windows Phone store has shut down and so the game is not available anymore.'}

Your objective is to find the one for you given clues to what they're wearing. Once you find them, you have to answer correctly to pass the 'compatibility' test. Every character is dynamically generated for each new run of the game. Warning: The game is unpolished as this was made in ~24 hours and was our first hackathon ever during our 3rd year as BS Computer Science students. No game engine was used; this was pure HTML/CSS/JS!"
